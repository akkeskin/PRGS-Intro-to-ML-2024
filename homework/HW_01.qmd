__Question 1:__ Use a programming language of your choice to save today's date to a variable.
Then, include the date in the text below the code block.

```{python}
# your code here

from datetime import datetime
# Get today's date
today_date = datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
today_date
print(f"Today's date is: {today_date}")

```

Today's date is: `<print(f"Today's date is: {today_date}")>`.
